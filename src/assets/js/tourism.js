Our ferries are diverse and range from mainline ferries that sail thousands of miles and make multiple stops, to shuttle ferries that provide daily links between neighboring communities. This allows riders the flexibility to access communities of choice by utilizing one or more vessel to reach their final destination through our regional hubs in Ketchikan, Juneau, Whittier or Homer.'
