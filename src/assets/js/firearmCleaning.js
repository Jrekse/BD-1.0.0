The system consists of the Iosso Bore Cleaner, the Iosso Premium Bore Brush, and the Iosso Triple Action Oil. The combination of these products will remove the nasty carbon burn, copper, lead, plastic wad and all other fouling associated with shooting. It’s great for people with allergies or intolerance to chemicals. The Bio-Based formulas are made from plant extracts. While keeping our environment healthy, it is also safer for the user, in that it is odorless. The blue brush is a trademark of Iosso, which stands for a quality product made in the USA.'
