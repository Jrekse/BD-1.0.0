Our belief is it is a gun and knife show not a gun/knife/flea market. We host a gun show that is family safe and family oriented. The majority of our vendors have their own shops back at home so you will find a very wide spectrum of guns, knives, and related products. We are not the biggest but we try to be the best.'
