        'content' : 'Diamond Lake Resort has evolved from a small fishing lodge built in the 1920s, to a modern family resort that offers year-round service. Recently added 110 full hook up RV spaces. It is a favorite summer spot for fishing (rainbow trout), hiking, bicycling, and horseback riding. In the winter it is famous for skiing, snowboarding and tubing, snowmobiling, and snowshoeing. All year round it is a wonderful place to take in the beauty of nature and of Crater Lake National Park.
