It features a steel rear sight base, a steel front sight base, 5 differently colored rear sight inserts and five differently colored front sights. In addition to each sight package having all ten colors, one may upgrade the front sights to our two glowing Firefly front sights — coral and lemon-lime. Both will glow for several hours when charged and will never lose the ability to hold a charge. With the ATPS, do not cover up any portion of the target; simply create a pyramid and place the tip-top of the pyramid where bullet impact is to occur. The ATPS is a completely customizable to the vision preferences of each shooter and is also windage and elevation adjustable. The Advantage Tactical Dark Diamond Sight is the only iron sight where an illuminated front sight alone, in subdued light, and without the ability to see the rear sight, is capable of making an accurate shot at combat distances. Of a different design than our ATPS Fireflies, the ATDDS is the most capable frontsight oriented handgun sight in the industry, whether in daylight or darkened situations. See adiamond in daylight or darkness and make your shot. The ATDDS rear sight obscures portions of the front sight to create a diamond sight picture, whether in daylight or subdued light. The ATDDS features an all steel rear sight base, steel front sight base, and our unique glowing Dark Diamond Firefly front sights. The ATDDS coral and yellow Firefly colors are standard with each sight set. We also have an aqua and lime-green upgrade, for those who desire more front sight color options. In addition, for those with yet to be designated Dark Diamond front sight colors, we have extra front and rear sight Dark Diamond bases, at a reduced price.'

Thomas listened to their input and suggestions, then with the help of some space age manufacturing processes and materials developed a 100% carbon fiber stock. This stock now owns just about all of the 1000 yard 50bmg records. After this, it all kind of snowballed.
