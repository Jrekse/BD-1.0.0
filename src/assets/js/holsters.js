        'content' : 'We are a small, family business of leather craftsman in Cooper, Texas, that started out making holster from our closed in back porch. Formerly known as DM Bullard Leather, we have changed to Bullard Leather and moved to Cooper, Texas. At Bullard Leather, everything is handmade and hand-molded for a perfect fit from Hermann Oak leather (Veg tanned). We believe all quality leather makers use Hermann Oak, as the quality comes from their tanning process done by our leather holster makers. The better the tanning process, the higher the quality of leather. Take a Tour of the Shop and Meet the Crew Here at Bullard Leather. We are working every day to make the best Gun Leather money can buy! Open Monday – Thursday 8:00 am to 4:00 pm.'
