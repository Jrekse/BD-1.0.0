Experience on the water makes for a fun time for my guests as I take you to some of the best fishing in Washington. Enjoy nature through all the seasons while catching Steelhead, Salmon, and Sturgeon. I cater to small parties of 2 to 6 people to ensure full service. All top quality gear is provided as well as bait and tackle. Locations change as fishing action changes, but some of my favorites include the Satsop, Wynoochee, Chehalis, Cowlitz, and Skykomish as well as others when hot.  Experience is not needed, as I am happy to teach you to cast and fish a spinning rod, baitcast rod, as well as to fly fish. I cure all my own bait as well as tie my own flies and jigs. I am licensed by the Coast Guard as well as the State and Insured. References are always available.

        'content' : "Fall Chinook salmon fishing in Oregon starts with salmon making their way into the Tillamook tributaries each year in fall. These fish typically range in weight from 15-30lbs and they put up a fun fight! To catch this fish we will be bobber fishing, back bouncing, & pulling plugs starting at the end of September. We continue following these big fish upriver with the goal to hook and bring dinner home through November! Salmon fishing in Oregon happens on the Wilson, Trask, Kilchis, and Nestucca rivers. (Sept-Nov) Acrobatic winter steelhead arrive shortly after the fall Chinook. These hard fighting chrome bullets typically start making their appearance in good numbers around Thanksgiving. From beads to jigs or bobber doggin’ to plugs, these fish are some of the most fun fish to catch all year! We target winter steelhead in the Wilson, Trask, Kilchis, & Nestucca rivers. (Dec-April) Two of the rivers we fish provide opportunity for you to give back to the river system in the form of Broodstock wild steelhead! If we are fishing one of these rivers and we catch a healthy wild steelhead, we will safely transport the fish in a live well (stored in my boat) back to the hatchery where they will spawn the fish and release them back to the wild to continue their journey. Typically the fish raised from the Broodstock wild steelhead are much larger and a harder fighting fish. Let's gofishing!"
