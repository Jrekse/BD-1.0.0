My employees are like family to me, and we pride ourselves in treating everyone with the same kind of care! We are a full service insurance agency. My team and I can help you with anything you need relating to State Farm Insurance products and services.  We strive to go the extra mile because we realize you have so many options with insurance these days!  We differentiate ourselves by providing a level of personal care you can`t get from 800 numbers. On a personal note I`m married to my high school sweetheart. We met at Fife High School.  We`ve been married since 04. After a long, and ultimately losing battle, to infertility we adopted! On our 15th wedding anniversary we were able to finalize the adoption of our son Samuel! We also have 3 crazy dogs, 1 hound dog named Boone and two "swamp poodles" Ginger & Duke! (If you know what swamp poodles are we need to talk!) Boone has a crazy story of how pet insurance saved his life! I have the news article about him hanging in our conference room. You`re welcome to stop by our office!  We are open until 6pm Monday - Thursday, 5pm on Fridays.  While you`re here check out all the furniture I`ve made!  It`s been a hobby of mine for years. My wife, Stacie, is thankful that my office is full of it. We`ve run out of room in our house!'
