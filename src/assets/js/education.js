        'content' : 'Most modern cruising vessels have many systems aboard that we enjoy, but they require inspection, care, and maintenance. Spend a day with ABYC Master Technician and Skagit Valley Colleges systems instructor Michael Beemer. Michael is a passionate instructor who will answer your questions and explain about systems from his 25+ years cruising/teaching experience in our area, and who isn’t selling anything. Whether you are upgrading or wanting to inspect and test your existing systems, this course will allow you to understand industry best practices and ABYC standards to make sure that your vessel is safe, comfortable, and reliable. Course will cover most systems aboard your vessel including: propane, bilge pumps, water-making, fire suppression, dinghy’s & davits, refrigeration, tankage, thrusters, & marine sanitation systems. We will be ending the day with a few new technologies worth considering.'
