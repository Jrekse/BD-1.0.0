        'content' : 'The Pikeminnow Sport Reward Fishery Program, funded by the Bonneville Power Administration and administered by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, pays anglers for each Northern Pikeminnow that they catch that is nine inches or larger. Northern Pikeminnow eat millions of salmon and steelhead juveniles in the lower Columbia and Snake rivers each year. The program goal is not to eliminate Northern Pikeminnow, but rather to reduce the average size and curtail the number of larger, older fish. Reducing the number of these predators can greatly help the salmon and steelhead juveniles making it out to sea.'
